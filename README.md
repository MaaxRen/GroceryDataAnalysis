# GroceryDataAnalysis
This repo is for the 2023-2024 University of Adelaide summer research project. 
This project is dedicated to investigate the changes in prices of grocery items over three years, with a primary focus on data gathered from leading retailers, Woolworth and Cole's. 
Our analysis will categorize these items and ascertain the corresponding inflation rates between three points in time, namely Dec 2020, Jul 2023 and Dec 2023. 
A pivotal question arose earlier this year: whether the prices of 'no name' brand groceries have risen more significantly than those of 'named' brand groceries. 
This raises implications regarding a potentially larger impact on lower-income families due to the increased cost of living. 
Our objective is to delve into this question and derive meaningful insights. 
Additionally, we will conduct a comparative analysis of grocery prices between the two major supermarkets, aiming to identify which one has experienced a greater increase in prices.
